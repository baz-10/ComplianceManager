## Development Workflow

### üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

#### Database Configuration
The application uses **Neon Serverless PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM. This works seamlessly for both local development and Replit deployment.

1. **Database URL**: Your current setup uses Neon, so you need:
   ```bash
   # .env or .env.local
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]/[database]?sslmode=require"
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
   ```

2. **Apply New Database Schema** (IMPORTANT - Run this first!):
   ```bash
   npm run db:push  # Applies all new table changes to your database
   ```
   **This will create the new tables:**
   - `audit_logs` - For compliance tracking
   - `document_signatures` - For digital signatures  
   - `approval_workflows` - For approval processes

3. **Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev      # Starts development server on port 5000
   ```

#### üö® IMPORTANT: Database Migration Required
**Before you can see the new compliance features, you MUST run:**
```bash
npm run db:push
```
This creates the new audit tables and schema changes. Without this, you'll get database errors.

#### Seeing Changes Locally
- **Database changes**: ‚úÖ Run `npm run db:push` to apply new schema (REQUIRED)
- **Frontend changes**: ‚úÖ Hot reload automatically applies  
- **Backend changes**: ‚úÖ Server restarts automatically with tsx
- **New features**: ‚úÖ Navigate to `/admin/compliance` after db:push

### üöÄ Replit Deployment Notes
Since you mentioned deploying through Replit:

1. **Environment Variables**: Set in Replit Secrets
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Your existing Neon database connection string
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key

2. **Database Migration**: 
   ```bash
   # In Replit console/shell:
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. **Deployment Process**:
   - ‚úÖ Push code changes to GitHub
   - ‚úÖ Replit auto-pulls from GitHub  
   - ‚úÖ Run `npm run db:push` in Replit shell (one-time for new schema)
   - ‚úÖ Features immediately available

4. **Database Persistence**: Since you're using Neon, your database persists across deployments

## üìÑ PDF Migration System

### Migration Tools Added
**Files Created:**
- `migration/README.md` - Migration guide and instructions
- `migration/migration-helper.js` - Database population utilities
- `docs/` - Directory for placing PDF files to migrate
- `MIGRATE_PDFS.md` - Quick start workflow guide

### How PDF Migration Works
1. **Place PDFs**: Put your existing documentation in `docs/` folder
2. **Claude Analysis**: Claude reads PDFs directly using the Read tool
3. **Structure Detection**: Automatically identifies sections, headings, and policies
4. **Database Population**: Creates manuals, sections, and policies with proper formatting
5. **Content Formatting**: Converts PDF text to HTML for rich text editor

### Migration Workflow
```bash
# 1. Place your PDFs in docs folder
ComplianceManager/docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ operations-manual.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ safety-procedures.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ casa-compliance.pdf

# 2. Ask Claude: "Please read the PDFs in docs and migrate them"
# 3. Claude will analyze and create migration scripts
# 4. View results at /manuals
```

### Migration Features
- **Smart Structure Detection**: Identifies document hierarchy automatically
- **Content Preservation**: Maintains formatting and organization
- **Database Integration**: Populates all tables with proper relationships
- **Audit Logging**: All migrations tracked for compliance
- **Draft Status**: Imported content starts as DRAFT for review

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### üö® "Table does not exist" errors
**Problem**: New audit tables haven't been created yet
**Solution**: 
```bash
npm run db:push  # Creates audit_logs, document_signatures, approval_workflows
```

#### üö® "Cannot access /admin/compliance" 
**Problem**: New routes not recognized or database tables missing
**Solutions**:
1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Apply database schema: `npm run db:push`
3. Check you're logged in as ADMIN user

#### üö® PDF Export not logging to audit trail
**Problem**: Audit service failing silently
**Check**: Server console for "Failed to log export event" warnings
**Solution**: Ensure audit_logs table exists (`npm run db:push`)

#### üö® Database Connection Issues
1. **Neon Database**: Ensure DATABASE_URL includes `?sslmode=require`
2. **Environment Variables**: Check `.env` file or Replit Secrets
3. **Connection Test**: Server logs show "Database connection initialized successfully"

#### üö® TypeScript Errors After Updates
```bash
npm run check        # Validate TypeScript types
npm install          # Ensure all dependencies installed
```

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production  
npm run db:push      # Apply database schema changes
npm run check        # TypeScript type checking
```

## Performance Notes
- Audit dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds
- Pagination implemented for audit trail (50 items per page)
- Database queries optimized with proper indexes needed
- Large export files may take time to generate

## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist

### For Local Development:
- [ ] 1. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in your environment
- [ ] 2. **CRITICAL**: Run `npm run db:push` to create new tables
- [ ] 3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
- [ ] 4. Login as an ADMIN user
- [ ] 5. Navigate to `/admin/compliance` to see new features
- [ ] 6. Test PDF export (should now have better formatting)
- [ ] 7. Check audit trail in compliance dashboard

### For Replit Deployment:
- [ ] 1. Push code changes to GitHub
- [ ] 2. Replit auto-pulls latest changes
- [ ] 3. **CRITICAL**: Run `npm run db:push` in Replit shell
- [ ] 4. Restart Replit application if needed
- [ ] 5. Test compliance dashboard at `/admin/compliance`

### First Time Setup (Important!):

## üîë Password Reset Feature

### Implementation Completed (2025-07-28)
**Files Modified:**
- `server/controllers/userController.ts` - Added `resetPassword` method
- `server/routes.ts` - Added POST `/api/users/:userId/reset-password` route
- `client/src/pages/UserManagement.tsx` - Added password reset UI with dialog

**Features:**
- Admin-only password reset capability (no email required)
- Validation for minimum 6-character passwords
- Audit logging for all password reset actions (HIGH severity)
- Visual key icon button next to each user (except current user)
- Modal dialog for entering new password
- Real-time validation feedback

**Security Considerations:**
- Only admins can reset passwords
- Cannot reset your own password
- All password resets are logged to audit trail
- Passwords are hashed using scrypt with salt
