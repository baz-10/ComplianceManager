# ðŸ“„ PDF Migration Workflow

## Quick Start: Migrate Your Existing Documentation

### Step 1: Place Your PDFs
```bash
# Place your PDF files in the docs folder:
ComplianceManager/docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ operations-manual.pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ safety-procedures.pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ casa-compliance.pdf
â””â”€â”€ emergency-procedures.pdf
```

### Step 2: Tell Claude to Read and Migrate
Simply say: **"Claude, please read the PDFs in the docs folder and migrate them to the database"**

Claude will:
1. âœ… Read each PDF file directly
2. âœ… Analyze the document structure (sections, headings, content)
3. âœ… Generate database migration scripts
4. âœ… Create manuals, sections, and policies in your database
5. âœ… Format content for the rich text editor

Alternative: Inâ€‘App Import (Admin/Editor)
- You can also upload DOCX/PDF via the import endpoint:
  - `POST /api/import` (multipart field `document`, form `dryRun`, `granularity=h2|h3` for DOCX, `manualTitle`)
  - Dry-run returns a preview tree; commit creates a DRAFT manual
  - Requires: `npm install mammoth pdf-parse`

### Step 3: View Results
```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:5000/manuals
```

## What Happens During Migration

### PDF Analysis
- **Document Structure**: Identifies main sections and subsections
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts text and preserves formatting
- **Hierarchy Detection**: Maps PDF structure to Manual â†’ Section â†’ Policy

### Database Population
- **Manual**: Each PDF becomes a manual
- **Sections**: Major headings become sections  
- **Policies**: Subsections/procedures become policies
- **Versions**: Each policy gets version 1
- **Status**: All items start as DRAFT for review

### Content Formatting
- Text is cleaned and formatted for HTML
- Headings are preserved with proper HTML tags
- Paragraphs are structured correctly
- Lists and formatting are maintained where possible

## Example Migration Result

**Input**: `operations-manual.pdf` with sections:
- Flight Operations
- Maintenance Procedures  
- Safety Protocols

**Output** in Database:
```
Manual: "Operations Manual"
â”œâ”€â”€ Section: "Flight Operations" 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Policy: "Pre-flight Procedures"
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Policy: "In-flight Operations"
â”œâ”€â”€ Section: "Maintenance Procedures"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Policy: "Daily Inspections"
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Policy: "Scheduled Maintenance"
â””â”€â”€ Section: "Safety Protocols"
    â”œâ”€â”€ Policy: "Emergency Procedures"
    â””â”€â”€ Policy: "Risk Assessment"
```

## After Migration

### Review and Refine
1. **Check content**: Navigate to `/manuals` to review migrated content
2. **Edit if needed**: Use the rich text editor to refine formatting
3. **Publish when ready**: Change status from DRAFT to LIVE
4. **User acknowledgments**: Users can then acknowledge policies

### CASA Compliance
- All migrations are logged in the audit trail
- Content changes are tracked with version history
- Digital signatures can be added later
- Compliance tracking is automatic once published

## Support
If migration doesn't work as expected:
1. **Check PDF format**: Ensure PDFs have selectable text (not scanned images)
2. **Review structure**: Complex layouts may need manual adjustment
3. **Ask Claude**: "Can you analyze the structure of [filename].pdf and suggest improvements?"
