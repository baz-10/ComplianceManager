Before approving any operations within 3NM of controlled aerodromes the Chief Remote Pilot will ensure a validinstrument has been issued by CASA and the proposed operations is within the conditions of the instrument.2. Remote pilots associated with the operation holds a valid CASA Remote Pilot License (RePL) and aviation radioqualification (AROC or equivalent)3. The remote pilot will not conduct operations unless a current NOTAM advising of RPA operations in the operating areais active.4. Before any operation in the approved area is conducted, the Chief Remote Pilot will carry out a risk assessment thatdetails hazards associated with the proposed operation and risk mitigation strategies,5. Unless otherwise stated on the CASA instrument, the remote pilot will:a) Contact the Tower ATC Shift Manager, prior to commencing operations to ascertain the correct VHF frequency and/orany additional operational requirements;b) Advise ATC upon the completion of RPA operations;c) Establish reliable VHF coverage for the nominated frequency prior to the commencement of operations and maintain alistening watch on the assigned frequency as outlined in subpart 5(a) for the duration of each flight;d) Advise ATC of a mobile phone number for ATC to contact the operator if required;e) Follow any direction given by ATC.6. The remote pilot will immediately notify ATC of an “escape” event, which is where the RPA is not under control of theremote pilot.7. The remote pilot will not activate any transponder fitted to the RPA or to transmit ADS-B position information unlessspecifically directed to do so by ATC.8. During RPA operations, the remote pilot will ensure an authorised observer (the observer) is utilised for each flight inaccordance with the operator’s operations manual.9. The remote pilot will ensure that the RPA is equipped and operated with an active fail- safe mode that will ensure that,in the event of a data-link loss with the RPA, the RPA will:a) adjust altitude to the minimum safe level to provide obstacle clearance and minimum potential for collision with otheraircraft; andb) transit to a predefined safe landing or flight termination area; andc) land or otherwise terminate the flight.10. The remote pilot will conduct operations in accordance with the company’s Operations Manual. If it is impossible forthe remote pilot to comply with a provision of the company’s Operations Manual and a condition in the approvalinstrument, the remote pilot must comply with the condition in the approval instrument.Specialised OperationsNational Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / 2.1HandoverVersion 1National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / 2.2Operations outside of day VMC conditionsspecifically at nightVersion1.2Unless otherwise permitted by a separate instrument of approval from CASA all operations at night must only beundertaken in class G airspace below 400ft AGL with the aircraft remaining within visual line of sight at all times.Operations at night must only be conducted by the chief remote pilot or authorised remote pilots named below whohave completed training and testing in the operation of an RPA at night and who are current on type.

Assessment of anyoperations should include a detailed review of the forecasted weather conditions on the day to ensure VMCrequirements can be met.Additionally an onsite assessment must be undertaken by the chief remote pilot/remote pilot to ensure the operationwill be within VMC. Note: cloud base heights can be difficult to discern at night and can drop rapidly, so extreme cautionshould be taken where operations are conducted where low cloud base is anticipated.Operations at night must only be conducted where a Job Safety Assessment has been completed and signed off by thechief remote pilot. All Job Safety Assessments must include an onsite recce which has been conducted in day VMC. Thisrecce should be used to identify any obstacles or hazards that would not be apparent to a pilot flying at night suchas power lines or building antenna’s etc.All take-off and landing areas must be illuminated to near daylight conditions to assist the pilot in safe take-off andlanding.The RPA must be fitted with the following equipment; all equipment noted below must be checked as part of any pre-flight procedure and should be included within National Drones RPA maintenance program.• Serviceable GPS for the purpose of providing accurate data to the GPS hold and GPS return to home function.• Telemetry data which indicates a positive satellite lock has been achieved by the RPA. Where the manufacturer does notspecify a number of satellites to gain lock then the aircraft shall not fly with less than seven (7) satellites positivelyacquired.• Telemetry data which indicates to a base station which is co-located with the pilot in command the RPA’s position inthree dimensional airspace, that is to say distance and bearing from the operator and a height above ground level. • Sufficient lighting to ensure positive identification of the RPA once in flight, and to ensure that the orientation anddirection of the aircraft can be determined visually by the Pilot in Command.• During the JSA process consideration must be given if rain or if thunderstorms are observed or reported within 5km ofthe operational location.The chief remote pilot must ensure that the RPA is not flown, within 500 feet vertically and within 1500 metreshorizontally of any aircraft.As part of the JSA process the CRP must consider the safety benefit associated with having at least one person who istrained as an observer in accordance with the operator’s Operations Manual:• is in a location that enables that person to assist with traffic avoidance; and• has continuous two way communication with the remote pilot of the RPAThe CRP must ensure that the RPA is equipped and operated with an active fail safe mode that will ensure that, in theevent of a data-link loss with the RPA or any loss of control of theRPA, the RPA will:• adjust altitude to the minimum safe level to provide obstacle clearance and minimum potential for collision with otheraircraft, in any case not above 400feet AGL;• transit to a predefined safe landing or flight termination area; and• land or otherwise terminate the flight.National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / 2.3Operations between 30m and 15m - Non-company personnelVersion 1Any operation within 30 metres of non-operational personnel requires the following equipment as a minimum. The RPA should have: • a dual parallel redundant battery system with duplicated battery mountings• demonstrated ability to fly safely with one motor inoperative at the maximum takeoffweight for the operation• GPS hold and return to home function must be operational with a minimum receptionof at least 7 GNSS satellites. As part of the procedure for operation within 30m of non-operational personnel, the Chief Remote Pilot must, in additionto all other normal operational requirements, perform adetailed risk assessment that specifically considers the increased risk of operations in close proximity of people. The riskassessment is not limited to, but must consider, the following:• speed of the machine• size of the machine• speed of the non-operational personnel• non-operational personnel’s awareness of the RPA’s position at all times• flight path in relation to non-operational personnel• number of non-operational personnel involved• position of controller in relation to RPA and non-operational personnel• environment, wind, sun, lighting etc.• possibility of GPS shadows or turbulence around buildings• available safe options in event of control issues.Once the risks to a particular operation have been identified the Chief Remote Pilot must implement sufficient strategiesto mitigate the risks. Mitigation strategies are not limited tobut include the following:• Safety Crew to assist controller• restricted flight and duty times• use of smaller or lighter RPA• restrictions on flight profile• reduced maximum wind speed• different propellers• propeller guards• vertical separation• RPA speed restrictions• reduced number of non-operational personnel within 30m of RPA• pre-determined plan of action in case of control or other issues.If the risk cannot be mitigated to a value that meets an acceptable level of safety or it is not possible to comply with acondition within the operations manual and any other instrumentissued by CASA the task should not proceed.The Chief Remote Pilot must also consider the overall risk where multiple risk factors have a high score.Consent of third partiesAny operation within 30 to 15m of a person(s) requires the consent of each individual. The Chief Controller should notethat a body corporate or any other entity cannot give suchconsent on behalf of any individual.When seeking consent all individuals should be informed of the CASA regulation as written, and any additional risksidentified by the operator that may be attributed to the operation ofthe RPA within 30m of a person. Whilst not a requirement, CASA recommends that a written briefing is provided to eachperson, and each person is asked to sign a consent formattached to the briefing. Gaining written consent in this way will ensure that should an incident or accident occur, theoperator can demonstrate to any investigating authority thatthey had operated within the intent of the regulation.

The RPIC will have theability to take manual control of the aircraft at any time, and is expected to do so if the automated flight isn’tproceeding as planned. ·                  Launch Procedures: RPIC to verify readiness and reports to the local ground controller that theaircraft and crew are operationally ready. ·                 Once crew receive the command Aircraft 1 “clear for take off, climb to x altitude at rally point x” thenthe flight crew are clear to commence the take-off roll. Upon reaching the designated rally point and take-off altitude the aircraft will be placed into a loiter to await further instructions. ·                 At this point, verification that the mission controller has control will be confirmed. The RPIC and themission controller will then work together to monitor the systems, including battery levels, ground speedand airspeed requirements, as well as tracking tolerances. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / BVLOS Operations / NormalProcedures / 2.9.5.2After Take-OffVersion 1 ·                 After the take-off segment has been completed (the aircraft reaches a safe altitude and isplaced into a loiter pattern, in accordance with section above,       the take-off is considered to becomplete and the following will occur. ·                 The HOO will issue an instruction to the RPAS operating crew to track to a rally point. ·                 The RPAS operating crew will confirm the rally point with the HOO and then ensure the aircraft istracking to that point. The confirmation will occur with a read back of the correct rally point. ·                 The rally points may be given designations of November Echo (North East), Sierra Echo (South East)Sierra Whiskey (South West) and November Whiskey (North West). ·                 The HOO will issue an instruction such as “Aircraft, track to November Echo, climb to 600 feet, reportholding November Echo”. The GCS is to report back the entire instruction which will confirm to the HOOthat it has been understood and complied with. ·                 For simplicity – generally these 4 rally points will be used as tracking areas. However additionallocations will be identified to use as emergency tracking areas if necessary.  This will also dependcompletely on the project and location.

However the general guidelines for deconflict will be as follows. HOO to determine the position, altitude and tracking destination of aircraft. Once established the operating crewwill execute the following:·                 HOO informs all RPAS crew and spotters·                 HOO attempts to de-conflict with aircraft using separation and segregation    - RPA directed to descend to safe altitude (nominally below 400 feet AGL)   - RPA then directed to track to rally location clear of manned aircraft and populous area  - Once relevant event has been resolved, the RPA then directed to recommence operationIn the event that a relevant event cannot be mitigated, ensure that the RPA is safely manoeuvred away fromthe path of the manned aircraft and return for landing as soon as safe to do so.Note: At all times, a minimum of 500 feet vertical separation and 1500 metres horizontal separationmust be maintained from all manned aircraft. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / BVLOS Operations / Non-Normal Procedures / 2.9.6.6Failure in Automatic Take-offVersion 1            Once automatic take-off command is sent to aircraft the motor should ramp-up within 2 seconds of themission planner reporting “Take-off on runway”.  If this does not occur then the aircraft should be switchedback to manual.·          If the take-off roll exceeds 100m, the take-off must be aborted by switching to manual, reduce throttle tozero and apply back pressure till the aircraft comes to a stop.·          If the aircraft has become airborne and the GCS is reading a critical error, the pilot must switch to manualcontrol, lower the aircraft nose and then assess the situation. If there is enough runway left, land the aircraftusing the remainder; if there isn’t enough runway to land safely, the pilot may make an appropriate turn andland in a suitable field or if the aircraft has sufficient height, the pilot may make a 180 degree turn and landon the runway.National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / BVLOS Operations / Non-Normal Procedures / 2.9.6.7Failure of System during operationVersion 1·          If the GCS shows a critical error/failure during flight or the pilot observes unusual flying characteristics, theaircraft must immediately be taken over by the Mission Controller and guided back to VLOS or the RemotePilot for recovery. ·          If the RPA suffers an engine failure during the operation, it must be immediately taken over by Missioncontrol. If the RPA is within gliding distance of the landing area, it is to be guided back to VLOS of RemotePilot and switched to manual for landing. If the RPA is beyond gliding range of the landing area, it is to beguided by Mission Control to a suitable field using the GCS. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / BVLOS Operations / Non-Normal Procedures / 2.9.6.8Failure During LandingVersion 1·          During the landing approach, the plane relies heavily on the values reported by the range sensor. If thedata received from the range sensor does not seem to be feasible, the plane will abort landing and beginloitering. The plane will loiter around the landing waypoint at an altitude defined as follows: loiter_altitude = landing_abort_altitude + 2 * param_climbout_diff“landing_abort_altitude” is the altitude at which the plane was when the landing was aborted.“param_climbout_diff” is defined by the parameter “FW_CLMBOUT_DIFF” 18 ·          To prevent the plane from aborting during landing, always be sure that the altitude of the waypoint prior tothe landing waypoint does not exceed 70% of the maximum range of the range sensor. ·          If, during the automatic landing, the aircraft is in an unusual attitude or to low/high, the pilot may switch tomanual control and complete a go-around or continue with the landing. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / BVLOS Operations / Non-Normal Procedures / 2.9.6.9BVLOS Weather limitationsVersion 1During all BVLOS operations, VMC is to be maintained at all times.

If BVLOS of RPIC, as directed by the observer. RPIC or observer selects suitable landing site, maintaining communication with one another. RPIC informs observers for crash response. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / EVLOS Operations. / Non-Normal Procedures / 2.12.5.5Failure in Automatic Take-offVersion 1Once automatic take-off command is sent to aircraft the motor should ramp-up within 2 seconds of the mission planner reporting “Take-off on runway”. If this does not occur then the aircraft should be switched back to manual. If the take-off roll exceeds 100m, the take-off must be aborted by switching to manual, reducethrottle to zero and apply back pressure till the aircraft comes to a stop. If the aircraft has become airborne and the GCS is reading a critical error, the pilot must switchto manual control, lower the aircraft nose and then assess the situation. If there is enough runway left, land the aircraft using the remainder; if there isn’t enough runway to land safely, the pilot may make an appropriate turn and land in a suitable field or if the aircraft has sufficient height, the pilot may make a 180 degree turn and land on the runway. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / EVLOS Operations. / Non-Normal Procedures / 2.12.5.6Failure of System During OperationVersion 1If the GCS shows a critical error/failure during flight or the pilot observes unusual flying characteristics, the aircraft mustimmediately be </span>guided back to VLOS for the Remote Pilot by observers for recovery. If the RPA suffers an engine failure during the operation, it must be immediately taken over by RPIC if flyingautonomously.If the RPA is within gliding distance of the landing area, it is to be guided back to VLOS of Remote Pilot and switched tomanual for landing. If the RPA is beyond gliding range of the landing area, it is to be guided by the observers to a suitablefield using the GCS, using radio communications as outlined in this manual.  Procedures for Loss of Radio andTelephone Communications in anEVLOS Operation Class 2National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / EVLOS Operations. / Non-Normal Procedures / Procedures for Loss of Radio and Telephone Communications in an EVLOS Operation Class 2 /2.12.5.7.1Communication LossVersion 1In the event, during an EVLOS operation class 2, the communication is lost between the RPIC and the observer, whetherdue to UHF limitations or environmental factors, both the RPIC and relevant observer must immediately switch to mobiletelephone to attempt restabilizing communication.If mobile network coverage is limited or unavailable, satellite phones should be used as a substitute. The need to carrysatellite phones should be assessed when conducting the initial planning stages of operation before arriving to the site.If communication is comprised between the RPIC and observer due to a breakdown in procedural communicationrelating to the observation of the RPAS. The RPIC is to give clear, calm and direct instructions to observers so that theycommunicate clearly and slowly with him/her over the UHF or telephone.  If communication cannot be re-established, the RPIC is to execute the RTH function immediately to mitigate thepossibility of the RPA becoming a hazard. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / EVLOS Operations. / Non-Normal Procedures / Procedures for Loss of Radio and Telephone Communications in an EVLOS Operation Class 2 /2.12.5.7.2Loss of Situational AwarenessVersion 1In the event that situational awareness is lost by the observer in an EVLOS operation class 2, where the RPA is BVLOS ofthe RPIC, the observer and RPIC are to immediately adopt the following procedure: Observer is to immediately communicate SA loss to RPIC over UHF radio or mobile/sattelite phone. Regardless of RPA category, the RPA mission must be terminated. If RPA is a MR and semi-autonomous, RPIC is tobring RPA to stable hover; if RPA is a fixed wing, RPIC is to adopt a holding pattern and climb to safe height ifneeded.  In both cases of RPA category, ensure abiding to height limitations of 400ft AGL, or by conditions of CASA approval. RPICto then communicate estimate position of the RPA to observer, using GCS map or mission controller. RPIC to end the flight by executing RTH/RTL function on remote controller or mission controller to safely bring theaircraft back into EVLOS or VLOS. If necessary and all other options have been exhausted, RPIC may need to end the flight by means of controlledflight of RPA into terrain (if possible, without creating hazard to other aircraft, people or property). Operations Between 30-15 metresNational Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Specialised Operations / EVLOS Operations. /Operations Between 30-15 metres / 2.12.6.1Non-company personnel consent formVersion 1    30 metres to 15 metres Consent Form This form is to be completed by individual(s) that are consenting to Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS or drone)operations within 30 metres, but not closer than 15 metres to their person.  As per CASR 101.245, National Drones would like to gain your consent to operate a RPAS (drone) within 30 metres ofyourself, but no closer than 15 metres.

This section of the operations library covers theconsiderations and requirements when conducting a tethered operation. A project will normally only have a tetheringrequirement when there is a height restriction placed on an instrument issued by CASA, this is normally to avoid enteringan OLS (Obstacle Limitation Surface) but there may be other reasons for this.The main purpose of the tether is to prevent an “escape” event, whereby the drone makes an un commanded flyawayinto airspace above, causing an issue for manned aircraft operating from that aerodrome.Tethered operations must only be conducted where it is specified as a condition on an instrument of approval fromCASA, or otherwise approved by the Chief Remote Pilot. Tethered Operations must only be conducted by the chiefremote pilot or authorised remote pilots who have been trained on or observed tethered operations.There are certain operations that must not be conducted tethered; such as aerial mapping or an operation area with toomany obstructions. Furthermore, Tethered operations are not to be conducted above 50 metres AGL under NationalDrones operations. The higher the drone is flying (tethered) the more weight is added to the drone and this mayunsatisfactorily alter the flying characteristics of the aircraft.The tether must be made to National Drones’ approved specifications and can only be created by people approved inwriting by the Chief Remote Pilot. The materials used for construction must include:High strength and highly visible (fluorescent colour normally) utility cord, 3mm diameter, minimum 100kgbreaking strain (See images in later sections)High Strength Carabiners (See images in later sections)An anchor point connected to the tether operator through a harnessReel with a locking mechanism (See images in later sections)National Drones have considered the following when selecting the materials to be used:speed of the machineSize of the machineNumber of rotorsThe maximum force exerted on the tetherConstruction of TetherAt this point in time the tether systems constructed by National Drones are only approved for use on the Inspire 1 andPhantom 4. Other systems will be developed at a later date. National Drones Remote Pilots are not under anycircumstances to construct their own tether systems.Each tether will be constructed as per the images below for the Inspire 1 and Phantom 4.(Image 1 – Inspire Tether – Connection points) (Image 2 – Inspire Tether – Connection points to main line) (Image 3 – P4 Tether-Connection points) (Insert Image of Reel and Harness) Both tethers have been designed to have four connection points to the RPA. This is to ensure that the aircraft doesn’tlose stability when the limit of the tether is reached. The Inspire design utilises carabiners attached to the landing gearunder each rotor. The tether line is attached to the carabiners using a bowline knot. The P4 design utilises strong holdVelcro secured to metal rings, that are connected to the tether line. The tether has been designed so that the attach point isn’t a fixed point, which may cause the drone to topple in theevent that it hits the tether limit quickly. By engineering it with two “U” shaped diagonal stirrups, threaded through acarabiner or sliding attachment, the point at which the main line of the tether attaches to the drone is able to slide backand forwards which allows the load to be taken up gradually, rather than all at once.As can be seen above, the assembly between the connection point line and the main line is through two metal rings (forP4) or through a metal clip (for Inspire 1). These materials are chosen not only for their strength but also for weight.Having a weight between the mainline and connection lines will ensure the mainline remains below the aircraft anddoesn’t become entangled in the rotors. The main line is then attached to a reeling mechanism (see image 4) that operated by the Tether operator. The reel musthave a locking mechanism that can be used when the RPA reaches the limit of the tether.From the reel the main line will then be attached to a harness worn by the Tether Operator (see image 4). Training Requirements for Tethered OperationsTo ensure integrity of systems amongst the group, any operation requiring tether will be approved by head office, andthe approved tether system sent to the appropriate RPIC by head office. The RPIC will also need to have undergonetraining on tethered operations to a standard deemed to be satisfactory by the CRP. This is to ensure consistencyamongst the group.All persons undertaking tethered drone operations must have completed practical familiarisation training with the chiefpilot or delegated training authority before undertaking any tethered drone operations. The training will take place in anobstruction free area with no or limited access for members of the public. Training shall include:Risk & hazard identificationLikely scenarios for tethered operationsManufacture of tethered line and associated equipment such as anchor pointsEmergency proceduresPractical demonstration of tethered ops in a controlled environment PIC and Tether Operator flight training The training for PIC and the Tether Operator shall follow the below structure:Calculating the maximum length of tetherNational Drones must calculate the actual length of tether permitted by using the following formula and referenced table:Length of tether permitted (actual) = T Length of tether permitted as per MOS chapter 4 = a Elevation of tetherground attached point (google earth must be used) = b Aerodrome reference point (ARP) elevation = c (referencetable in section 1.8)Equation: T = a – (b – c)Example: Where the tether ground attachment point is 250 ft AMSL; the aerodrome elevation is 200 ft AMSL: and thelocation is assumed to be in the grey area with a maximum tether length of 150 ft.T = 150 - (250 - 200) T = 150 - (50) T = 150 - 50 T = 100 ft Part 1 – setting up tetherUsing the approved tether provided by head office, measure out the main line to the limit that is imposed by the CASAcondition (e.g. 30 metres). Mark the limit with electrical tape. Now cut the main line using scissors just below the tapemark. Inspect the tether system for any faults, tangles or breakages. Wind up the main line using the reel system; but ensure there is 5 metres of main line left from the connection line. Connect the reel mechanism to the harness. Have the Tether Operator put on the harness, secure it and ensure the reel is locked.Have the PIC pull on the main line with enough force to test the security of the tether system. (if the line breaks orbecomes damaged operations must be ceased).Connect RPA (either Inspire 1 or P4) to the main line, as shown in the images above. Part 2 – Take-off and climbWhen the tether operator and PIC are ready. Place RPA in take-off area. Stand approximately 3 metres behind the RPA.Arm the aircraft and slowly take-off to 1 metre. Ensure the aircraft is stable and tether is still secure.The tether operator must now unlock the reelHave the PIC slowly climb the aircraft to maximum height limit. As this occurs the tether operator must slowly un-reel thetether to ensure the slack in the line is sufficient to enable climb but not enough that the line suffers too muchmovement due to wind. Once the RPA reaches its maximum height (this will normally be seen by the tether operator once the main line iscompleting un-reeled) the Tether Operator must notify the PIC to stop the climb. The reel must now be placed in the locked positionPart 3 – Manoeuvring the RPAIt is important that every manoeuvre done by the PIC is very slow and smooth.Once the maximum height is reached by the RPA have the PIC very slowly begin some manoeuvres. This can include:Pitching, Yawing and rolling levellevel circleslevel figure of 8Practice taking images or videoPart 4 – Descending and landingOnce the trainer is satisfied that the PIC has completed sufficient manoeuvres it is now time for the descent. The PIC is to manoeuvre the RPA over the take-off/landing area. The Tether Operator must now unlock the reel.The PIC is to very slowly begin a vertical descent. As this is happening the Tether Operator must slowly reel in the tether;ensure the line is tight enough to limit the chance of the tether being moved by wind or the line becoming tangled in theRPA. It’s also important that the line isn’t reeled in too fast either, this may cause the RPA to be pulled down and becomeunstable. Once the RPA has reached 3 metres above the landing point the RPA must be stopped, the tether operator must nowlock the reel. Once the reel is locked and the Tether Operator confirms with the PIC the RPA may continue its descent and land.The PIC is to Disarm the aircraft. Risk and Hazard Identification As part of the procedure for tethered operations, the Chief Remote Pilot or approved Remote Pilots must, in addition toall other normal operational requirements, perform a detailed risk assessment and JSA that specifically considers theincreased risk of operations with a physical tether. The risk assessment and JSA is not limited to, but must consider, thefollowing:The obstructions within the intended flight pathThe meteorological conditions, e.g. wind speedThe security of the tether tie pointsThe strength limitation of the tetherPerson and property within the tether radiusActions if the RPA has a fly away Deployment at Site Upon arrival at site, the remote pilot in command is to test the integrity of the tether and give the entire system athorough visual inspection to ensure all joins, and attach points are secure.Special consideration and attention needs to be paid to the following components of the tether systemEnsure all joins, and attach points are secure.Ensure there is no fraying, or knotting of the systemEnsure that the anchor to the Tether Operator, is unable to become detachedThe area where the tether is to be deployed is clear of obstructionsThe RPIC should also ensure that the mechanism for unrolling and retrieving the tether whilst airborne operateseffectively, and has no knots, or anything that it can be caught on which will cause issues in flight.Based on the instrument issued by CASA, the RPIC is to measure out the distance of the tether which corresponds to thedistance limit issued on the instrument. A piece of tape or similar marking is to be used to show that the tether cannot beextended beyond this distance.The anchor point of the tether system is also to be connected at this point. This will ensure that the drone will be unableto exceed the maximum limitation height as indicated on the CASA instrument.Flight Operations The procedures during flight operations are the same for the training in section 3.4.1, that being:1. setting up tether2. Take off and Climb3. Manoeuvring the RPA (in this case, completing the intended operation)4. Descent and LandingWhen the PIC is operating the RPA it is important to remember the following:When manoeuvring the RPA, in air movements need to be kept to a small, and as soft as possibleHave clear communication with the Tether Operator during all stages of flightThe Tether Operator must ensure:The line is securely connected at all stagesThe communication to PIC is clearThe right amount of slack in the mainline is maintained to limit the chance of the tether effecting the aircraftThe reel is locked and unlocked at the correct stages of flightEmergency procedures In the event that the tether system fails, or the RPA breaks free of the tether. The PIC must initiate a return to home assoon as reasonably practicable. In the event of a fly away, the tether becoming tangled in the rotors or obstruction to the point that the RPA losescontrollability the PIC may use a combination Stick Command (Left stick down + Return to Home Button) to kill themotors. Suitability and impact on public safety for this will need to be assessed at the time.In the event the tether becomes caught on a structure but does not become uncontrollable. The PIC may manoeuvre theRPA to untangle the main line. Remote Pilots approved for tethered operations The following list of National Drones pilots are people who are approved to conduct tethered operations, and haveundergone training by the Chief Remote Pilot, and//or also observed a tethered operation.Name of RP Date Approved Approved by John Kirton 6th March 2017 Ben Harris - Chief Remote Pilot Richard Bazen 20th June 2017 Ben Harris - Chief Remote Pilot Juan Valencia 20th June 2017 Ben Harris - Chief Remote Pilot  Vic Thomson 2nd May 2019  Ben Harris - Chief Remote Pilot        Appendix 10 - Operations over andnear people.National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / Appendix 10 -Operations over and near people. / 5.10.1ApplicabilityVersion 1.4These procedures are applicable to RPA operations conducted in a rail corridor only which is either:‘live’ (ie. trains are operating)near adjacent roads and footpaths [within 30 m]near residential / industrial properties [within 30 m]over a road or footpaths (including rail bridges)Within 30 meters of persons not directly involved with the operation of the RPA Within populous areasNear and over moving vehiclesAll conditions above are to be conducted in accordance with Temporary Management Instruction RPA Operations overor near people - 2024-01, the SORA safety case associated with the operation, and the National Drones OperationsManual and Library documentationNOTE: These procedures are only to be conducted on the authority of the CRP.National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / Appendix 10 -Operations over and near people. / 5.10.2Rules of InterpretationVersion 1.2The following terms and definitions will aid the user when reading and interpreting the requirements for operationswithin a live rail corridor.“Must” and "shall" indicates a mandatory requirement. Compliance is not optional, and failure to comply mayresult in safety violations or operational non-compliance.•Example:“The operator must maintain a visual line of sight with the drone at all times.”"The operator shall maintain a visual line of sight with the drone at all times"“May” indicates that an action is permitted or allowed but is not mandatory. It provides discretion based onsituational factors.•Example:“The operator may use an automated flight path, provided it adheres to all safety regulations.”“Should” is used to recommend a course of action that is highly advised but not mandatory. However, insituations where safety is critical, “Must” should be used instead of “Should” to eliminate ambiguity.•Example: “The operator should perform a quality assurance (QA) review of the collected data after each flight to ensureaccuracy and completeness, although this is not a mandatory requirement.”•Example where must is used:“The operator must verify that the area is clear of uninvolved persons before commencing flight.”National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / Appendix 10 -Operations over and near people. / 5.10.3OONP DefinitionsVersion 1Active participants A person who is participating directly in the activity to which the RPA is operated.Note: The scope of persons who may be an active participant is broader than the scope ofpersons 'directly associated with the operation of the RPA' under CASR 101.245 and mayinclude persons such as performers and emergency services personnel.Active participants are those persons directly involved with the operation of the RPA or fullyaware that the RPA operation is being conducted near them.

This policy aligns with CASA’s guidance on improving tactical avoidance and situational awareness.ScopeThis policy applies to all drone operations conducted by National Drones where there is a potential risk to non-involvedpersons, particularly along adjacent footpaths, walkways, or other public areas within the operational volume of thedrone flight. This specifically applies to areas for which an instrument of approval has been given to operate over andnear people in accordance with CASA TEMPORARY MANAGEMENT INSTRUCTION RPA Operations over or nearpeople - 2024-01 Situational Awareness and Risk Assessment:Prior to the commencement of any operation, the RPIC shall conduct a thorough risk assessment of theoperational area, focusing on the proximity of footpaths, walkways, and other public spaces.This assessment can be done at the desktop stage, using GIS tools such as google earth, or other informationsources. The RPIC shall assess whether there is a risk of non-involved persons entering the operational volume or beingexposed to potential hazards during the operation.Deployment of Signage:If the RPIC deems there to be a potential risk to non-involved persons, appropriate signage will be deployed atstrategic locations around the operational area.Signage must clearly indicate that drone operations are in progress and warn non-involved persons to avoid thearea for their safety.Signs should be placed at all entry points to the operational area, including entrances to footpaths, walkways, andany other accessible public spaces within the flight geography.Public Awareness Measures:In addition to signage, other public awareness measures may be employed, such as verbal announcements or theuse of a loudspeaker, where appropriate.The RPIC may also consider the use of visual aids, such as cones or barriers, to further demarcate the operationalarea and guide non-involved persons away from the flight path.  National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / OperatingConditions and Limitations / 5.11.7RPA Fall trajectory calculationVersion 1.3RPA fall trajectory must be calculated so the PiC can factor in the danger zone when planning and considering thefeasibility of the operation.To ensure safe operations, the fall trajectory of an RPA equipped with a Parachute Recovery System (PRS) is calculatedconsidering several key factors. These include the initial height of the aircraft, its average descent rate under theparachute, and the maximum horizontal wind speed during operations. The calculation helps establish a ground riskbuffer that accounts for potential horizontal drift during descent, ensuring that any ground impact occurs within acontrolled and defined area.1. Vertical Descent Time CalculationThe time it takes for the RPA to reach the ground is determined using the formula:t =h/vWhere h is the initial altitude (60 meters) and v is the average descent rate of the parachute (4.5 m/s). For ouroperation, this results in an approximate descent time of 13.33 seconds.2. Horizontal Drift CalculationTo account for horizontal displacement, we consider the maximum wind speed allowed under these operations,which can push the RPA horizontally during its descent. Given a wind speed of 5 m/s and a descent time of 13.33seconds, the horizontal drift is calculated as:Horizontal Drift= v . t = 5.m/s . 13.33.seconds = 66.67.metersThis indicates that the RPA could drift up to 66.67 meters horizontally due to wind while descending with theparachute deployed.3. Establishing the Ground Risk BufferThe calculated horizontal drift of 66.67 meters is used to define the ground risk buffer. This buffer ensures that anyunexpected deviations in flight, coupled with wind drift during a parachute-assisted descent, will occur within asafe, pre-established zone. By incorporating this buffer into our operational planning, we mitigate the risk topeople and property on the ground, ensuring compliance with safety standards and regulatory guidelines.1.Vertical Descent Rate with Parachute: Our RPA is equipped with a parachute recovery system thatcontrols the descent rate to approximately 4.5 m/s in the event of an emergency.2.Wind Drift During Descent: We have factored in the maximum operational wind speed of 5 m/s, whichcould cause the RPA to drift horizontally as it descends under the parachute.3.Time to Reach the Ground: Given the initial altitude of 60 meters, the RPA will take approximately 13.33seconds to descend to the ground (calculated by dividing the altitude by the descent rate).4.Horizontal Drift Calculation: During this descent time, the wind will cause the RPA to drift horizontallyby approximately 66.67 meters (calculated by multiplying the wind speed by the descent time).Flight Geography  - In our CONOPS, the flight geography is defined by the DSS boundary, which is a controlled groundarea and cannot be accessed by the general public due to fencing and restrictions placed along the entire rail corridor.Contingency Volume - is defined as the airspace volume that is allocated around the flight geography where theoperation can continue to occur safely in the event of a failure or emergency. This volume accounts for potentialdeviations from the planned operation due to unforeseen circumstances, such as: Pilot reaction time delays: For example, if the pilot needs a few seconds to regain control after an unexpected event.System failures: Such as a loss of control link or other technical issues that might cause the RPA to deviate from itsintended path.Environmental factors: Including sudden changes in wind direction or speed that could push the RPA outside theplanned flight geography. The contingency volume for our RPA operations has been calculated to ensure the safety of both the operation and thesurrounding areas in the event of an unexpected deviation from the planned flight path. This volume accounts forpotential delays in pilot response and other factors that could cause the RPA to temporarily exit its designated flightgeography. Pilot Reaction Time: We have conservatively estimated a 3-second delay in pilot reaction time, during which theRPA could continue moving horizontally before corrective action is taken.Horizontal Speed: Given the maximum speed of the RPA is 5 m/s, this results in a potential horizontaldisplacement of 15 meters (5 m/s * 3 seconds) before the pilot regains control.Ground Risk Buffer: The ground risk buffer is a critical safety measure designed to protect individuals andproperty on the ground in the event of an unexpected descent of the RPA. This buffer ensures that, even if theRPA deviates from its intended flight path and descends, it will do so within a pre-defined area that minimises therisk to people and property.Vertical Descent Rate with Parachute: Our RPA is equipped with a parachute recovery system that controlsthe descent rate to approximately 4.5 m/s in the event of an emergency.Wind Drift During Descent: We have factored in the maximum operational wind speed of 5 m/s, which couldcause the RPA to drift horizontally as it descends under the parachute.Time to Reach the Ground: Given the initial altitude of 60 meters, the RPA will take approximately 13.33 secondsto descend to the ground (calculated by dividing the altitude by the descent rate).Horizontal Drift Calculation: During this descent time, the wind will cause the RPA to drift horizontally byapproximately 66.67 meters (calculated by multiplying the wind speed by the descent time).Ground Risk Buffer Definition: The ground risk buffer is therefore set to 81.67 meters around the operationalvolume, ensuring that any potential drift during descent remains within a safe, controlled area that mitigates risksto persons and property on the ground. Note: Other aircraft can be substituted in for calculations by the pilot here by modifying the vertical descentrate based on their PRS descent rate numbers.   National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / OperatingConditions and Limitations / 5.11.8CommunicationsVersion 1Where crews aren't co located and a spotter is being utilised to assist with ensuring the ground area is clear, an approvedmeans of communication must be established to ensure crew can effectively communicate and that the spotter canadvise the RPIC if a person moves into the operational area.

The Aurecon geoportal also has access to thisinformation as DEM or contour data.   In-Flight Monitoring and Height VerificationProcedure: During flight, the Remote Pilot should periodically verify the altitude readings and compare themagainst known elevation changes within the operational area.Purpose: To detect any potential deviations from planned altitude due to variations in terrain.Action: If the Remote Pilot notices the altitude may be dipping below the safe threshold, they should initiate analtitude correction to regain safe separation from the ground.Use of Ground Control Points (GCPs) for Relative Altitude CalibrationProcedure: Where possible, set up visible Ground Control Points (GCPs) with known surveyed altitudes across theoperational area.Purpose: Allow the Remote Pilot to cross-reference the RPA’s altitude reading with these GCPs, helping to accountfor any differences between take-off altitude and actual terrain elevation.Action: Periodically check the RPA’s altitude relative to GCPs, particularly when flying near terrain features withvariable elevation.Use of H20 with LRF Periodically when using the H20 with Laser Range Finder - the remote pilot should aim the camera vertically downand use the LRF to establish the height above the terrain and ensure it is above the PRS minimum deploymentaltitude. This will allow the pilot to determine their height above the terrain is a safe height PRS Deployment Conditions:The PRS shall be automatically or manually deployed under the following conditions:Loss of control or communication with the UA.Detection of critical system failures that could result in uncontrolled descent or collision.If the UA enters a descent trajectory towards uninvolved persons or other critical areas.IAW with the Use of PRS in contingency scenarios sec 5.15.5.1 (Procedure: Use of the Parachute recovery system) ofthe Operational Library. The RPIC has the authority to manually trigger the PRS if any of the above conditions are met or if the flight safety iscompromised.Safety Distance Compliance:•Maintain a minimum lateral distance of 5 meters from uninvolved persons at all times during operations. Thecombination of low-speed mode and PRS is intended to ensure this distance is sufficient to prevent injury in the event ofa system failure. Use of other tools to assist in maintaining an appropriate distance from uninvolvedpersonsRPIC Use of Gridlines in DJI Pilot for Situational AwarenessObjective:To enhance situational awareness during drone operations which are approved by CASA as Operations over and Nearpeople and for which a valid instrument of approval has been issue, the Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) is required touse and monitor the gridline feature available in the DJI app. This tool aids in ensuring that all ground areas are monitoredeffectively, thereby reducing the risk of an impact with any person who may be at risk. This is valid for operations wherethe camera/sensor is Nadir and applies to the P1 and L1/L2 sensorsGround Observation:The RPIC will utilise and monitor the gridlines on the RPA controller to observe ground areas that may pose a riskdue to the presence of uninvolved, unsheltered people. The RPIC is expected to tactically adjust the flight pathbased on real-time observations to mitigate the risk of impact.Distance Assurance:The RPIC shall ensure that no uninvolved, unsheltered person enters the square in the middle square of thegridlines displayed on the DJI app. This square guarantees a minimum distance of at least 12 meters between theperson and the RPA when flying at a minimum altitude of 60 meters.Visual Line of Sight (VLOS):All operations will be conducted under Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) conditions, ensuring that the RPIC and theobserver have a continuous visual reference of the aircraft and the surrounding area. This visibility allows theoperator to observe the flight area as well as any people at risk, enabling the modification of the flight path ifnecessary.Situational Awareness:The gridline feature is used to complement VLOS, enhancing the RPIC’s ability to monitor and keep clear ofunsheltered people at all times. Unsheltered people are defined as those who are not under any form of cover, notin a vehicle moving at less than 60 km/h, or not inside a residential or industrial building, including shoppingcenters.Operational Implementation:Scan Development:The RPIC shall develop and maintain an efficient scanning pattern to ensure that the aircraft remains within thesafe operational area. The gridlines serve as a visual aid to maintain situational awareness, but they shall notdetract from the RPIC’s ability to maintain direct VLOS of the aircraft at all times.Monitoring and Tactical Mitigation:Throughout the operation, the RPIC and ground support team shall continuously monitor the operational area toensure that non-involved persons do not enter the flight geography.The RPIC can utilise all tools and tactics available to them, including the use of the video feed from the RPA - solong as this doesn't interfere with their ability to see, orient and navigate the aircraft. An efficient scan shall beconducted.If non-involved persons are observed approaching the operational area, the RPIC shall take immediate tacticalaction to avoid overflight, including adjusting the drone's flight path or temporarily halting the operation ifnecessary. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / Appendix 12 - RailCorridor Specific Flight Procedures / 5.15.4Operating RPAVersion 1.1Operating RPAOnce the pre-operational checks have been completed, the mission can commence. While conducting the mission thepilot must consider the following:Ensure the flight path is always planned and do not deviate unless an emergency situation occursEnsure you check heights of obstacles before conducting automated missionsWhen operating the RPA, the Remote Pilot and RPA must remain outside the safe approach distance (SAD) forordinary persons for AC and DC powerlines. The following distances must be maintained for the respectivepowerline voltage:3 m up to 132,000 V AC6 m between 132,000 V AC and 330,000 V AC8 m over 330,000 V ACDue to the nature of the tasks to be carried out (inspections), care shall be taken when conducting these operations. Thefollowing requirements shall be followed when conducting operating in the vicinity of infrastructure within the railcorridor:All RPA avoidance sensors shall be activeA minimum safe distance of 3 m must be maintained from rail electrical wires (high voltage)A minimum safe distance of 2 m must be maintained from all other infrastructure within the rail corridorTo ensure the RPA remains within the operating area - when operating with the PRS - flights shall be programmed at nofaster than 3m/s. The RPIC shall ensure by using the Remote Control that the aircraft does not exceed this speed nordeviate from the flight plan. Non-Normal/EmergencyProceduresNational Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / Appendix 12 - RailCorridor Specific Flight Procedures / Non-Normal/Emergency Procedures / 5.15.5.1Procedure: Use of Parachute RecoverySystem (PRS)Version1.2Purpose:To outline the procedures for the deployment of the Parachute Recovery System (PRS) when the RPA enters thecontingency area, ensuring it is only activated as a last resort when all other control measures have failed or when acritical failure occurs.Scope:These procedures apply to all operations involving unmanned aircraft equipped with a PRS, specifically during scenarioswhere the UA enters the contingency area, and the risk to the operation and uninvolved persons increases.Responsibilities:Remote Pilot-in-Command (RPIC): Responsible for monitoring the UA’s status and position, executing contingencyprocedures, and activating the PRS if necessary.Spotter: Responsible for ensuring that all personnel are briefed prior to operations and that the PRS is maintained andfunctional.As well as keep the RPA constantly within VLOS; or know the exact location of the RPA; and maintain constant situational awareness of the air space surrounding, and the ground below, the RPA operation;and remain in continual direct, verbal communication with the remote pilot using a radio or telephone communicationsystem; and do the following: 1. advise the remote pilot if the RPA is likely to become a hazard to any other aircraft, or any person or property;2. direct the remote pilot on the action required to ensure that the RPA operation does not become a hazard toanother aircraft, person or property; 3. immediately direct the safe termination of the operation if: - the exact location of the RPA is lost to the relevant observer’s direct sight or knowledge; or- the RPA becomes a hazard to another aircraft, person or property and termination of the operation is the only safecourse of action. Procedure:Entry into the Contingency AreaInitial Response:Upon detecting that the RPA has entered the contingency area, the RPIC shall immediately assess the situationand attempt to regain control of the RPA to return it to the operational volume.The RPIC should use all available control inputs and system functionalities (e.g., return-to-home, manualnavigation) to direct the RPA back to the flight geography.Communication and Monitoring:The RPIC shall continuously monitor the RPA's position, altitude, and system status. If possible, establishcommunication with other team members or ground observers to gather additional situational awareness.If the UA’s behaviour suggests an imminent exit from the contingency area or loss of control, the RPIC mustprepare for potential PRS deployment.Decision-Making Criteria:The RPIC should evaluate the following criteria to decide whether to continue efforts to regain control or to initiate PRSdeployment:Control Effectiveness: Are the control inputs having the desired effect? Is the UA responding appropriately?System Integrity: Is there a critical failure in any part of the UA’s systems (e.g., propulsion, navigation,communication) that compromises safety?Trajectory and Speed: Is the UA moving toward a hazardous area, such as uninvolved persons, criticalinfrastructure, or high-risk zones?PRS Activation as a Last ResortFailure to Regain Control:If the RPIC determines that control of the UA cannot be regained and the RPA is at risk of exiting the contingencyarea or causing harm, the PRS must be activated.Activation of the PRS must be executed if:All control measures have failed or measures to regain control.The RPA continues to deviate from the planned flight path, and there is no safe recovery option within theoperational or contingency area.Critical System Failure:If the RPIC identifies a critical system failure that compromises the safety of the operation (e.g., loss of propulsion,complete communication failure), the PRS must be immediately deployed to safely terminate the flight.The decision to deploy should prioritise the safety of uninvolved persons and property on the ground.Manual PRS Deployment:The RPIC shall manually activate the PRS using the designated control mechanism (e.g., dedicated switch on thecontrol unit) if the decision to deploy is made.Ensure that the PRS deploys correctly and monitor the descent to ensure it lands in a safe area, minimizingpotential damage.Post-PRS Deployment ActionsSecure the Area:After PRS deployment, the RPIC should inform the team and, if applicable, any ground personnel in the vicinity tosecure the area where the UA is expected to land.Ensure that uninvolved persons are kept away from the landing site.Reporting and Documentation:The RPIC shall document the incident in the flight log, including:The time and reason for entering the contingency area.Steps taken to regain control.The decision-making process leading to PRS deployment.The performance of the PRS and the outcome of the deployment.A formal incident report should be submitted as per National Drones Procedures to the relevant regulatoryauthorities.System Inspection and Reset:After recovery, the PRS system must be inspected for any damage or issues as part of the internal investigation. The PRS MUST be sent back to the manufacturer (Parazero) for repacking. This is in accordance with ASTM F3322-18 compliance. National Drones personnel are not to re-pack or re-use the PRS once it has been deployed. National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / Appendix 12 - RailCorridor Specific Flight Procedures / Non-Normal/Emergency Procedures / 5.15.5.2Limitations of PRSVersion 1.5The Manufacturer limitations of the Safe Air ASTM Mavic 2 System are as follows.

If safe to do so, land the RPA immediately followingstandard emergency procedures.    •    Secure the Area: Ensure the operating vicinity is secure and that no additional risks are present due to the PRSfailure.Recording Required InformationIn the event of a PRS failure (whether commanded or Un commanded activation), the RP must record the followinginformation:    •    Specific Location of PRS Activation Failure    •    Record exact GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). (Obtain from flight logs)    •    Note any relevant landmarks or environmental features. (Obtain from google earth imagery)    •    Distance Between Transmitter and RPA at Time of Failure    •    Measure and record the horizontal distance in meters.    •    Include altitude of the RPA at the time of failure.    •    Presence of High-Powered Emitters in Operating Vicinity (OV)    •    Document any known high-powered emitters such as radio towers, cell towers, radar installations, or other sourcesof electromagnetic interference within the OV.    •    Nature of the Failure    •    Commanded Failure: PRS failed to activate upon command.    •    Uncommanded Activation: PRS activated without command from the RP.    •    Provide a detailed description of the failure circumstances.Reporting PRS FailuresInternal Reporting    •    Complete the PRS Incident Report Form in section 15.5.8 of the National Drones Operational Library immediatelyafter securing the RPA.    •    Submit the completed form to the Chief Remote Pilot within 24 hours of the incident.External Reporting    •    The Chief Remote Pilot is responsible for reporting the incident to CASA as per operational approval requirements.    •    If the PRS failure rate exceeds 1E-2 per flight hour, the Chief Remote Pilot must notify CASA even if individualincidents have been reported.Monitoring and Analysis Data Recording    •    Maintain detailed records of all PRS activations, failures, maintenance activities, and flight hours.    •    Use these records to calculate the PRS failure rate per flight hour.Threshold Monitoring    •    Continuously monitor PRS failure rates.    •    Implement additional safety measures or maintenance protocols if failure rates approach the 1E-2 threshold.Continuous Improvement    •    Analyse incident reports to identify patterns or recurring issues.    •    Update training, maintenance procedures, or operational policies as necessary to mitigate identified risks.Maintenance Recording Requirements    •    Record all maintenance actions performed on the PRS.    •    Document any defects or anomalies found during inspections.    •    Ensure maintenance records are kept up-to-date and are easily accessible for review.Record Retention    •    Retain all PRS-related records, including incident reports and maintenance logs, for a minimum of 7 years.    •    Ensure records are stored securely and are available for audit by CASA or other regulatory authorities upon request.ResponsibilitiesRemote Pilots (RPs)    •    Adhere strictly to this policy and complete all required documentation promptly.Chief Remote Pilot     •    Oversee the implementation of this policy.    •    Ensure all incidents are reported to CASA as required.    •    Monitor PRS failure rates and take action if thresholds are exceeded.Maintenance Personnel    •    Perform regular inspections and maintenance of the PRS where allowed by the OEM.     •    Accurately record all maintenance activities and findings.National Drones Pty Ltd RPAS Operational Procedures (Library) / Appendices to Operational Library / Appendix 12 - RailCorridor Specific Flight Procedures / Non-Normal/Emergency Procedures / 5.15.5.8PRS Incident Report FormVersion 1PRS Incident Report FormPlease complete all sections of this form and submit it to the Chief Remote Pilot within 24 hours of the incident.1.
